## System Calls
A C++ program that makes direct system calls to read() and write() without using the standard C library.

```Instructions


- Download .zip file
- Extract
- Call 'make'
- Call './experiment --buffer_size XXXX --file_name test.txt --write_count XXXX' to make a write system call
- Call './experiment --buffer_size XXXX --file_name file.txt --read_count XXXX' to make a read system call
- Fill XXXX with the size/count 


```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Output

The program should print the amount of bytes written/read and how long each operation took.
